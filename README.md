# ChristmasMoviePicker

This is a project which allowed me to build and practice some beginning programming skills with a goal in mind.

We have chosen 24 Christmas movies that we would like to watch, one every day in December leading up to Christmas.

This picker will randomly choose one movie for each day, printing a schedule of movies to watch.

Alternatively, users can switch out any movies they do not want with preferable movies.
